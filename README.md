Before running use npm on both client, server and base root.

How to run: Client
npm start

Server:
cd rest
npm start or use PHP Server extension.

It might also fail on the server end if you dont do : yarn add cross-fetch. So make sure to do this as well!

Info: This is a React app that uses the Staw Wars API to generate a list of people, planets and starships. Aditionally it allows you to pull up an individual person and search the site for people.

It also uses express endpoints in the server.

Happy coding!
