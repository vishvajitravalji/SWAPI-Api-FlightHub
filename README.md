Before running use npm on both client, server and base root.

## Setup
To run this project, install it locally using npm:

For run Client
```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

For run Server
```
$ cd rest
$ npm start or use PHP Server extension.
$ PHP Server: Serve project	
$ PHP Server: Stop project	
$ PHP Server: Reload server	Stops the running server and starts it again.

It might also fail on the server end if you dont do : yarn add cross-fetch. So make sure to do this as well!

Info: This is a React app that uses the Staw Wars API to generate a list of people, planets and starships. Aditionally it allows you to pull up an individual person and search the site for people.

It also uses express endpoints in the server.

Happy coding!
